<h1><u> G_BigInt</u> </h1>
<h2>Documentation : </h2>
<p>Here we will describe how to use the G_BigInt in our code.<br>Open this code in your editor and do what you want to do in main function</p>
<pre> <h3>Declaration : </h3> </pre>
<p> declare BigInt variable like other's variable . for example, <b>G_BigInt</b>  x,y,z;<br> there is two way to initialize G_BigInt;
  One is using constructor . for example: <b>G_BigInt </b>  x("23243");<br>
  or using string . for example:<br><b> string </b> str="3435453543";
 <br>                     <b>G_BigInt </b> x=str;<br>
  <br>
  but we <b>can't</b> initialize like <b>G_BigInt </b>  x="2324"; or <b>G_BigInt </b> x=23434235435345454 ; 
</p>
<h3>Input and Output:</h3>
<p> Input can be taken using <b>cin </b> >>variable_name ;<br>
  and print the output using <b>cout</b><span> << </span>variable_name;<br>
</p>
<h3>Arithmetic Operators : </h3>
<p>
<pre>+ 	addition </pre>
<pre>- 	subtraction </pre>
<pre>* 	multiplication</pre>
<pre>/ 	division</pre>
<pre>% 	remainder after division</pre>
<pre> usage is as like as we do in integer but here both should be G_BigInt </pre>
 </p>
<h3>Relational Operator :</h3>
<pre> < , <= , > , >= , == , != </pre>
<pre> usage is as like as we do in integer but here both should be G_BigInt </pre>
<h3> increment and Decrement : </h3>
<pre> usage is as like as we do in integer. for example : x++; ++x; x--;--x; </pre>
<h3> Assignment Operator : </h3>
<pre> we can do : x+=y; x-=y; x*=y; x/=y;x%=y </pre>
<pre> usage is as like as we do in integer but here both should be G_BigInt </pre>
<h3>sign change : </h3>
<p>we change sign as we do in integer : x=-x; here x value will be -x.<br> we need to use - before the variable </p>
